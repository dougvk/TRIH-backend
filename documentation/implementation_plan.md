## Notes
- The ingestion process supports only remote HTTP RSS feed URLs as detailed in the PRD.
- Duplicate episodes are only logged and not updated, ensuring production data safety when not using production mode.
- Extensive logging is configured to output to both console and a log file (`logs/app.log`), per requirements.
- The system's static tagging taxonomy is stored in `/src/constants/taxonomy.py`, facilitating future updates if necessary.
- Testing is enabled by default, with production mode activated only via an explicit CLI flag (`--prod`)

**Implementation Plan for Podcast RSS Feed Processor**

Below is a step-by-step plan organized into phases. Each step cites the relevant section from the PRD or related documents. Note that the application is CLI-based and written in Python 3.13+ using libraries such as requests, lxml, sqlite3, openai, pytest, python-dotenv, and argparse.

    *   Reference: PRD Section 1 & 4

2.  **Implement Database Module** - Done

    *   Action: Create `/src/modules/database.py` to handle all SQLite operations including connecting to the database (use `data/episodes.db` for production and a separate test.db for test mode), creating tables, and indexing.
    *   Specifics: Define the `episodes` table with columns and indexes as described in the PRD.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 4, Database Schema

3.  **Implement Feed Ingestion Module** - Done

    *   Action: Create `/src/modules/ingest.py` for fetching RSS feed data using the `requests` library and parsing the XML using `lxml`.

    *   Reference: PRD Section 2 (Feed Ingestion)

4.  **Implement Duplicate Detection** - Done

    *   Action: Within the ingestion module, add logic to check if an episode with the same title exists in the database. If a duplicate is found, log the incident without updating any existing record.

    *   Reference: PRD Section 2, Duplicate Detection

5.  **Implement Content Cleaning Module** - Done

    *   Action: Create `/src/modules/clean.py` which performs a two-stage cleaning process:

        *   Step 1: Apply regex-based filtering to remove known promotional content.
        *   Step 2: Call OpenAI API to perform context-sensitive cleaning.

    *   Ensure that both original and cleaned descriptions along with cleaning status and timestamp are stored.

    *   Reference: PRD Section 2 (Content Cleaning)

6.  **Implement Episode Tagging Module** - Done

    *   Action: Create `/src/modules/tag.py` to implement automated tagging.
    *   Details: Construct prompts using episode title and cleaned description, call OpenAI's API (using GPT-3.5-turbo) to get tagging JSON, and update the episode record in the database.
    *   Add logic to extract episode numbers from titles if applicable.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 3 (Episode Tagging) and Tagging Taxonomy

7.  **Store Static Taxonomy Constants** - Done

    *   Action: Create `/src/constants/taxonomy.py` to store the static taxonomy for Format, Theme, and Track tags as constants. This file should allow future updates even though the taxonomy is static by default.
    *   File/Folder: `/src/constants/taxonomy.py`
    *   Reference: PRD Section 3, Tagging Taxonomy

8.  **Implement Export Module** - Done

    *   Action: Create `/src/modules/export.py` to enable exporting episode data from SQLite to JSON and CSV formats.
    *   Details: Allow selection of specific fields and enable a test run that only outputs to the console/log (defaulting to test mode unless production is explicitly specified).
    *   Reference: PRD Section 3 (Data Export)

9.  **Implement Tag Validation Module** - Done

    *   Action: Create `/src/modules/validate.py` to verify episode tags against the static taxonomy.

    *   Reference: PRD Section 3 (Tag Validation)

10. **Unit Testing Setup** - Done

    *   Action: Create tests in a directory `/tests` using pytest to cover modules: ingestion, cleaning, tagging, export, and validate.
    *   File/Folder: `/tests/`
    *   Reference: PRD Section 6, Testing & Maintainability

11. **Validation of Backend Modules** - Done

    *   Action: Write and run sample tests using `pytest` (e.g., `pytest tests/test_ingest.py`) to validate correct functionality of each module.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 6, Testing

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  **Integrate Ingestion Command** - Done

    *   Action: In `/src/main.py`, wire the `ingest` subcommand to call functions from `/src/modules/ingest.py`.
    *   Reference: App Flow: Feed Ingestion

2.  **Integrate Cleaning Command** - Done

    *   Action: Connect the `clean` subcommand in `/src/main.py` to functions in `/src/modules/clean.py`.
    *   Reference: App Flow: Content Cleaning Workflow

3.  **Integrate Tagging Command** - Done

    *   Action: Link the `tag` subcommand in `/src/main.py` to the tagging logic in `/src/modules/tag.py`.
    *   Reference: App Flow: Episode Tagging

4.  **Integrate Export Command** - Done

    *   Action: Connect the `export` subcommand in `/src/main.py` to functions defined in `/src/modules/export.py`.

    *   Action: Bind the `validate` subcommand in `/src/main.py` to functions in `/src/modules/validate.py`.
    *   Reference: App Flow: Tag Validation

6.  **Separation of Test and Production Modes** - Done

    *   Action: In the database module, check a global config (derived from command-line flags and .env) to decide whether to use the production database (`data/episodes.db`) or a test database (e.g., `data/test_episodes.db`).
    *   Reference: PRD Section 3 & Q&A about Test Mode

7.  **Logging Integration Across Modules** - Done

    *   Action: Ensure that each module uses the shared logging configuration established in `/src/main.py` to log messages to both console and file.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 4 (Logging and Real-Time Feedback)

8.  **Validation of End-to-End Flow** - Done

    *   Action: Run the full pipeline in test mode by invoking a sequence of commands: first `ingest`, then `clean`, then `tag`, followed by `export` and finally `validate`.
    *   Validation: Check logs (both console and file) to ensure the expected outputs and duplicate logging behavior.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 7

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  **Prepare Deployment Script** - Done

    *   Action: Create a shell script (e.g., `run.sh`) that activates the virtual environment and runs the CLI with appropriate flags (defaulting to test mode).
    *   File/Folder: `/run.sh`
    *   Reference: PRD Section 5, Deployment

2.  **Documentation and Usage Instructions** - Done

    *   Action: Create a `
